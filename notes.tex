\item The first task is to make a simple mass-spring cochlea model:

	\end{center}
It's not entirely clear what the $P_n$ term should be, but the rest of the system looks something like this:
\begin{align*}
	\ddot{x_i} &= - \frac{1}{m_i} \left( k_i x_i + c_i (x_i-x_{i-1}) + b_i \dot{x_i} \right)
\end{align*}
With $v_i=\dot{x_i}$, this translates into two equations for a dynamical system:
\begin{align*}
	\dot{v_i} &= - \frac{1}{m_i} \left( k_i x_i + c_i (x_i-x_{i-1}) + b_i v_i \right) \\
	\dot{x_i} &= v_i
\end{align*}
Of course, the actual dynamical system would have $2n$ equations, depending on the number
of oscillators included.
\end{itemize}
