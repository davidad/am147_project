\section{Goals}

Language is one of the most complicated phenomena in everyday life, and by far
the most common means by which human beings interact with each other. Viewed as
a dynamical system, it is fascinating that spatial (written) and temporal
(spoken) patterns can couple brain states so effectively! Our goal in this
project is \textbf{\pa{to model how neural states can be coupled physically by
acoustic transmission} \pb{to model how changing neural states representing
interpreted phonemes can create complex information structures in cortex}}.

\section{Plan}

\pa{We will begin by developing a computer simulation of the basilar membrane
of the cochlea, the organ responsible for mechanical spectral analysis of
incoming auditory stimulation\cite{nilsen09,ruggero97}. The basilar membrane
can be approximated as a series of coupled mass-spring oscillators with
different resonant properties \cite{hubbard06,hubbard96}.  We will test this
simulation by coupling the boundary conditions with recordings of actual
speech. Time permitting, we will develop a neural model of phoneme
classification \cite{mesgarani08}, which will be coupled to the output of the
basilar membrane model. We may even go so far as to attempt a mechanical cochlea
\cite{hubbard06,keolian97}.} \pb{We will attempt to develop a simulated dynamical system
which exhibits highly specific sequence dependence, so that many differences in
presented input patterns are essentially abolished in the output, but specific
differences of comparable magnitude reliably produce dramatically different
results.}
