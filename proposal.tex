\section{Goals}

Language is one of the most complicated phenomena in everyday life, and by far
the most common means by which human beings interact with each other. Viewed as
a dynamical system, it is fascinating that spatial (written) and temporal
(spoken) patterns can couple brain states so effectively! Our goal in this
project is \textbf{to model how neural states can be coupled physically by
acoustic transmission}.

\section{Plan}

We will begin by developing a computer simulation of the basilar membrane
of the cochlea, the organ responsible for mechanical spectral analysis of
incoming auditory stimulation\cite{nilsen99,ruggero97}. The basilar membrane
can be approximated as a series of coupled mass-spring oscillators with
different resonant properties \cite{hubbard06,hubbard96}.  We will test this
simulation by coupling the boundary conditions with recordings of actual
speech. Time permitting, we will develop a neural model of phoneme
classification \cite{mesgarani08}, which will be coupled to the output of the
basilar membrane model. We may even go so far as to attempt a mechanical cochlea
\cite{hubbard06,keolian97}.
