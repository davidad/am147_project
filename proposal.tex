\section{Goals}

Language is one of the most complicated phenomena in everyday life, and by far
the most common means by which human beings interact with each other. Viewed as
a dynamical system, it is fascinating that spatial (written) and temporal
(spoken) patterns can couple brain states so effectively! A key capability for
this process is the remarkable properties of the mammalian cochlea, the organ
that transduces the mechanical vibrations of sound into neural impulses. Our
goals in this project are \textbf{to understand quantitatively the function of
the cochlea} in the context of language, and \textbf{to study the
characteristics of the local parameter space}, with an eye toward the evolution
of the cochlea's capabilities (on the ``slow time-scale'' of evolution\cite{manley72}).

\section{Plan}

We will begin by developing a computer simulation of the basilar membrane of
the cochlea, the organ responsible for mechanical spectral analysis of incoming
auditory stimulation\cite{nilsen99,ruggero97}. The basilar membrane can be
approximated as a series of coupled mass-spring oscillators with different
resonant properties \cite{hubbard06,hubbard96}, as a cascade of filters
\cite{linggard89}, using finite element methods \cite{skrodzka05}, finite difference methods \cite{givelberg03}, or a variety
of other techniques. Our first task will be to evaluate each of these
approaches for ease of implementation, biological accuracy, and mathematical
elegance (or ease of analysis). After choosing and implementing a model, we
will test the simulation by coupling the boundary conditions with recordings of
actual speech. Time permitting, we will pursue some of the following
extensions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item analyze the sensitivity of cochlear functions to various tuning parameters \cite{yates90} and identify bifurcations
	\item develop a neural model of phoneme classification \cite{mesgarani08}, which will be coupled to the output of the
basilar membrane model
	\item attempt a mechanical cochlea \cite{hubbard06,keolian97}
\end{itemize}
